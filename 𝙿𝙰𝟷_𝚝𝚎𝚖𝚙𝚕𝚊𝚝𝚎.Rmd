# Import Data

I imported the following data that was uploaded from the following [location](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) on February 9th, 2016.

```{r import data , echo=TRUE }
raw_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
#View(activity)
```

# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

As per the assignment, the missing values can be ignored ...  *"For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset."*

```{r remove step na , echo=TRUE }
##Resulting data set below excludes missing data
data_for_this_section = raw_data[complete.cases(raw_data),]
```


##  Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r number of steps per day , echo=TRUE }
##Calculate summation by grouping by date
data_=with(data_for_this_section , aggregate(steps , by=list(Date=date) , FUN=sum ) )
##Rename column to reflect data within
colnames(data_)[2]="TotalNumberOfStep"
##Create table
kable( data_ )
```

## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r histo number of steps per day , echo=TRUE }
##create histogram of TotalNumberOfStep = data_[,2]
hist( data_[,2] , xlab = "Number of Steps per Day" , main = "Histogram of the Number of Steps Taken per Day" )
```

## Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

### Mean of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r mean , echo=TRUE }
##set numeric resolution to two decimals. Makes data pretty and prevents scientifics
options(scipen=2)
##calculate means
MeanValue=mean(data_[,2])
##print statement that incorporates the answer to question 
print(paste0("The **mean value** of the total number of steps taken each day is ", MeanValue , " ."))
```

The **mean value** of the total number of steps taken each day is `r MeanValue`. 

### Median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r median , echo=TRUE }
##calculate median 
MedianValue=median(data_[,2])
print(paste0("The **median value** of the total number of steps taken each day is ", MedianValue , " .")) 
```

The **median value** of the total number of steps taken each day is `r MedianValue`.

# What is the average daily activity pattern?


## Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r plot time series , echo=TRUE }
##work will complete (non-na) data
data_for_this_section = raw_data[complete.cases(raw_data),]
##Calculate means by interval
data_=with(data_for_this_section , aggregate(steps , by=list(Interval=interval) , FUN=mean ) )
colnames(data_)[2]="AverageNumberOfStepPerInterval"
#data_for_this_section = subset(data_for_this_section , interval==5 )
with(data_ , plot( Interval , AverageNumberOfStepPerInterval , type="l" , main=("The average number of steps taken, by 5-minute interval") ) )

```

## Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r max number of steps , echo=TRUE }
#sort by Average Step Interval descending
data2_=head(data_[order(-data_$AverageNumberOfStepPerInterval),] , n=1 )
#create table
kable(data2_)
#print statement
print(paste0("The following interval **",data2_$Interval, "** has the maximum number of steps, whose average across all days is **", data2_$AverageNumberOfStepPerInterval ,"** ."))
```

The following interval **`r data2_$Interval `** has the maximum number of steps, whose average across all days is **`r data2_$AverageNumberOfStepPerInterval `** .

# Imputing missing values

## Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

```{r keep na , echo=TRUE }
#create incomplete table
data_with_na = raw_data[!complete.cases(raw_data),]
#print statement
print(paste0("The number of missing values is the dataset is  **",nrow(data_with_na), "**."))
```
The number of missing values is the dataset is  **`r nrow(data_with_na)` **.

##Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

The strategy I deviced was to use the median value of the existing data at the interval, to fill up the missing data.

```{r imput na with median , echo=TRUE }
#create complete table
data_complete = raw_data[complete.cases(raw_data),]
#calculate median by interval from complete data
data_median =with(data_complete , aggregate(steps , by=list(Interval=interval) , FUN=median ) )
#merge incomplete data with median data 
data_merge=merge(x=data_with_na , y=data_median , by.x="interval" , by.y="Interval" , all=FALSE )
#set incomplete(na) steps as equal median
data_merge$steps=data_merge$x
```

## Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r create imput data , echo=TRUE }
#create table with imputted data
data_merge=data_merge[,1:3]
#merge complete data with imputted data
data_imput=rbind(data_complete, data_merge )
```


## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day with imputted data 

```{r number of steps per day imput , echo=TRUE }
#sum by date of complete imputted data
data_=with( data_imput , aggregate(steps , by=list(Date=date) , FUN=sum ) )
colnames(data_)[2]="TotalNumberOfStep"
#create histogram
hist( data_[,2] , xlab = "Number of Steps per Day" , main = "Histogram of the Number of Steps Taken per Day (Imputted)" )
```

## Calculate and report the mean total number of steps taken per day with imputted data 

```{r mean imput , echo=TRUE }
##set numeric resolution to two decimals. Makes data pretty and prevents scientifics
options(scipen=2)
MeanValue_imput=mean(data_[,2])
print(paste0("The **mean value** of the total number of steps taken each day is ", MeanValue_imput , " ."))
```

The **mean value** of the total number of steps taken each day is `r MeanValue_imput`. 


## Calculate and report the median total number of steps taken per day with imputted data 


```{r median imput , echo=TRUE }
MedianValue_imput=median(data_[,2])
print(paste0("The **median value** of the total number of steps taken each day is ", MedianValue_imput , " .")) 
```

The **median value** of the total number of steps taken each day is `r MedianValue_imput`.

## Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?

### means

Yes they do differ. 

Before imputting the mean was `r MeanValue`. 
After imputting, the mean value is `r MeanValue_imput`

### median 

Yes they do differ. 

Before imputting the median was `r MedianValue`. 
After imputting, the median value is `r MedianValue_imput`


## What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Based on the method that I selected i.e. using the median to imput missing values, both the mean value and the median value seem to decrease.


# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


## Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r weekday , echo=TRUE }
#logic to determine if a day is a weekend or a weekday. 
data_imput$Weekend=ifelse(weekdays( as.Date(data_imput$date) )=="Saturday" | weekdays( as.Date(data_imput$date) )=="Sunday" , "Weekend" , "Weekday")
##validation code below to confirm that the above procedure is correct
#unique(paste ( weekdays( as.Date(data_imput$date) ) , data_imput$Weekend))

```

## Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{r weekday plot , echo=TRUE }
#calculate mean by Weekend and interval
data_=with( data_imput , aggregate(steps , by=list(Weekend, interval) , FUN=mean ) )
colnames(data_)[1]="PartOfWeek"
colnames(data_)[2]="Interval"
colnames(data_)[3]="AverageNumberOfSteps"
#create plot
xyplot(AverageNumberOfSteps ~ Interval | factor(PartOfWeek), data=data_, pch=19,main="Number of Step vs Interaval, By Part of Week", xlab="Interval",  ylab="Average Number of Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l" )
```
